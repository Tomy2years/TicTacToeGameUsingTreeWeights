# TicTacToeGameUsingTreeWeights
This is a Java-based Tic Tac Toe game that implements an AI opponent using a game tree with weighted decision-making. The AI evaluates each possible move by assigning weights (100 for wins, 50 for ties, 0 for losses) and selects the move with the highest probability of success.
